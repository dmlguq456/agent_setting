# Codex Editorial Report Mode

This is a Codex-native realization guide generated from the portable mode
inventory. It is adapter-owned output, not a legacy runtime mode copy.

## Source Order

1. Read `roles/MODES.md`.
2. Read `roles/units/editorial/report.md` for the portable mode contract.
3. Run `adapters/codex/bin/preflight.sh mode-info editorial/report`.
4. Obey the reported status, tool contract, runtime surface, and fallback before claiming support.

## Codex Runtime Mapping

- Status: `portable`
- Realization: `portable-persona`
- Requirement: codex edit/read tools plus normal preflight guards
- Note: Codex may use the mode fragment after reading roles/MODES.md and resolving portable roles.

## Use

- Use Codex file, terminal, approval, sandbox, hook, and skill surfaces.
- Run `adapters/codex/bin/preflight.sh write <file> [session-id]` before edits.
- For `tool-contract` modes, run the named contract check before claiming the tool-backed result.
- If a required local provider or executable is unavailable, report the unavailable contract instead of silently downgrading.
- Treat `adapters/codex/modes/editorial/report.md` as the adapter-owned mode guide for this runtime.

## Projected Portable Mode Contract

The following contract is projected from `roles/units/editorial/report.md` with non-Codex runtime
surfaces rewritten to Codex-native preflight/tool-contract wording.

# Unit: editorial/report

Assemble already-verified artifacts into one final user-facing report. This unit is the
low-cost assembly stage at the end of a pipeline (code report, design handoff, lab eval
report, draft finalize) — it writes, it does not judge.

## Contract

- **Inputs are authoritative.** Compose only from the named input artifacts (plans,
  checklists, dev/test logs, review memos, eval tables, figures). Invent nothing beyond
  them; every substantive claim in the report must trace to an input artifact, cited by
  path.
- **No new QA.** Verification happened upstream. Do not re-review, re-test, or add
  findings. If an input is missing, contradictory, or unreadable, return `blocked` with
  the exact gap instead of papering over it.
- **Voice and language** follow `_voice.md` (audience-language first, rhythm rules,
  return discipline). Structure the report for the reading audience: outcome first,
  evidence next, remaining risk last.
- **Remaining risk is part of the report.** Carry forward unresolved warnings, skipped
  checks, and open decision points from the inputs verbatim-faithfully; a clean-looking
  summary that drops a known risk is a contract violation.
- Write the report to the assigned artifact path (node-owned scope); return per
  `_shared/dual-io.md`.
