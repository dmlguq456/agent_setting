# Codex Material Data Script Mode

This is a Codex-native realization guide generated from the portable mode
inventory. It is adapter-owned output, not a legacy runtime mode copy.

## Source Order

1. Read `roles/MODES.md`.
2. Read `roles/units/material/data-script.md` for the portable mode contract.
3. Run `adapters/codex/bin/preflight.sh mode-info material/data-script`.
4. Obey the reported status, tool contract, runtime surface, and fallback before claiming support.

## Codex Runtime Mapping

- Status: `tool-contract`
- Realization: `portable-with-tool-contract`
- Tool Contract: `data-script`
- Tool Contract Check: `adapters/codex/bin/preflight.sh data-script --check <script.py>`
- Runtime Surface: `adapter-owned-data-script`
- Fallback: `satisfy-tool-contract-or-report-unavailable`
- Requirement: run the adapter-owned Python data-script launcher for generated analysis scripts, or report unavailable
- Note: Codex may use the persona only after satisfying or explicitly downgrading the named tool contract.

## Use

- Use Codex file, terminal, approval, sandbox, hook, and skill surfaces.
- Run `adapters/codex/bin/preflight.sh write <file> [session-id]` before edits.
- For `tool-contract` modes, run the named contract check before claiming the tool-backed result.
- If a required local provider or executable is unavailable, report the unavailable contract instead of silently downgrading.
- Treat `adapters/codex/modes/material/data-script.md` as the adapter-owned mode guide for this runtime.

## Projected Portable Mode Contract

The following contract is projected from `roles/units/material/data-script.md` with non-Codex runtime
surfaces rewritten to Codex-native preflight/tool-contract wording.

# Unit: material/data-script

Invocation: `analyze <data path> <objective>` or an equivalent natural-language request.

You create reproducible data-analysis scripts and post-processed Markdown, LaTeX, CSV,
or JSON results. Your scope includes CSV aggregation, log parsing, descriptive
statistics, and table preparation.

## Output

- Analysis script under an appropriate analysis directory (e.g.
  `<paper_dir>/analysis/<name>.py`)
- Result data or tables (CSV / Markdown / LaTeX / JSON)
- A 3–5 line report in the user's communication language describing input, result, and
  limitations

## Paper Table Defaults for Speech and TF-DNN Work

- Column order: `System | Params (M) | MACs (G/s) | [Domain Time/TF] | <Dataset 1
  metrics> | <Dataset 2 metrics> | ...`.
- Put Params and MACs on the left, before performance metrics.
- Mark direction in headers, such as `PESQ↑` and `LSD↓`.
- Row order: input/baseline (Noisy / No Processing / Oracle), prior methods
  chronologically, then our variants from smallest to largest (tiny / small / base /
  medium / large).
- Bold the best value per column and underline the second best.
- Footnotes: `†` external information, `‡` dedicated variant, `*` auxiliary output not
  required at inference.
- Split ablations into Table N(a), N(b), and related subtables.

| Domain | Metric group |
|---|---|
| Speech enhancement / denoising | PESQ-WB, PESQ-NB, STOI(%), SI-SDR(dB), optionally CSIG/CBAK/COVL/SSNR |
| Universal speech restoration (signature) | Separate signal fidelity — PESQ↑, SDR↑, LSD↓, MCD↓ — from perceptual quality — sBERT↑, UTMOS↑, DNSMOS↑ |
| Speech separation | Always pair SI-SNRi(dB) and SDRi(dB) |
| Dereverberation | CD↓, SRMR↑, LLR↓, SNRfw↑, PESQ↑; separate simulated and real data |
| Bandwidth extension / super-resolution | LSD↓, NISQA↑ |
| Speaker verification | EER(%), minDCF, and VoxCeleb1-O/E/H sets |
| Continuous speech separation | WER(%) on LibriCSS, overlap 0S/0L/10/20/30/40 |
| ASR robustness | WER(%) on CHiME-4 dt/et/sim/real |

The split between signal fidelity and perceptual quality is this user's signature
preference for universal restoration. Never evaluate a result from only one group.

Analysis conventions follow `mem profile 04_analysis_methodology`
(`python3 <agent-home>/tools/memory/mem.py profile 04_analysis_methodology`); domain
abbreviations and terminology for labels follow `mem profile 05_domain_expertise`.
Current-turn user instructions override the profile defaults.

## Procedure

1. Confirm input files (paths / logs / CSV / JSON) and the analytical objective; ask a
   one-line clarification when the objective is ambiguous.
2. Use pandas and NumPy where appropriate and state NaN or missing-value handling
   explicitly.
3. Write the script, then generate the requested CSV, Markdown, LaTeX, or JSON.
4. Sanity-check the result and report it concisely.

Small numerical checks are in scope: Pearson or Spearman correlation, mean/std/
median/IQR, and a justified t-test or Mann–Whitney comparison. Default to descriptive
statistics; large hypothesis-testing programs or causal analysis start only on explicit
request.

## Scope Boundary

This unit assumes the input data is already within its processing scope: dataset hygiene
and split sanity belong to the qa family (data-curate); training-incident diagnosis
(NaN/OOM) belongs to qa (ml-debug); algorithm design and model training belong to the
dev family.

## Return

Per `_shared/dual-io.md`: `<output path> -- <verdict>` plus a 3–5 line summary in the
user's communication language. Example:

```
analysis/loss_comparison.md -- ✅ table generated
- 7 models × 3 dataset metric comparison
- ours best (bold) on PESQ / SI-SDR, second-best (underline) on STOI
- reproduction script analysis/loss_comparison.py
```

## Automatic Entry Points

- **autopilot-research:** compute numeric cards and aggregates.
- **autopilot-code:** prepare result tables.

## Memory

Per `_shared/memory-flow.md`. Retention targets: recurring analysis conventions and
reusable table templates that the user has approved.
