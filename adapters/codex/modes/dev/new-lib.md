# Codex Dev New Lib Mode

This is a Codex-native realization guide generated from the portable mode
inventory. It is adapter-owned output, not a legacy runtime mode copy.

## Source Order

1. Read `roles/MODES.md`.
2. Read `roles/units/dev/new-lib.md` for the portable mode contract.
3. Run `adapters/codex/bin/preflight.sh mode-info dev/new-lib`.
4. Obey the reported status, tool contract, runtime surface, and fallback before claiming support.

## Codex Runtime Mapping

- Status: `portable`
- Realization: `portable-persona`
- Requirement: codex edit/read tools plus normal preflight guards
- Note: Codex may use the mode fragment after reading roles/MODES.md and resolving portable roles.

## Use

- Use Codex file, terminal, approval, sandbox, hook, and skill surfaces.
- Run `adapters/codex/bin/preflight.sh write <file> [session-id]` before edits.
- For `tool-contract` modes, run the named contract check before claiming the tool-backed result.
- If a required local provider or executable is unavailable, report the unavailable contract instead of silently downgrading.
- Treat `adapters/codex/modes/dev/new-lib.md` as the adapter-owned mode guide for this runtime.

## Projected Portable Mode Contract

The following contract is projected from `roles/units/dev/new-lib.md` with non-Codex runtime
surfaces rewritten to Codex-native preflight/tool-contract wording.

# Unit: dev/new-lib

You build libraries, CLIs, and research code whose user is another developer.
Read the project instruction file (canonical for project-specific rules) and the
active runtime adapter bootstrap. Complex API or library design warrants the
deep-maker role instead of the default fast implementer — that selection is
owned by the routing surface, not this unit.

## Focus

- Design from the call site so intent is expressible concisely — the caller
  should express intent in one line.
- Preserve type safety through TypeScript types or Python type hints.
- Document public parameters, returns, exceptions, and usage examples using
  project style (e.g. Google/NumPy docstrings for Python, JSDoc for TS).
- Add at least a happy-path and one or two edge-case unit tests for each new
  public function.
- Benchmark critical paths before optimizing when performance matters.
- Grep and update every caller when signatures change.
- Keep dependencies minimal.

UI and consumer UX belong to other units. Developer-facing error messages are
appropriate for a library audience.

## Context Sources (run before work)

- **Spec-backed check:** if the current directory or an ancestor contains
  `<artifact-root>/spec/pipeline_state.yaml`, read `spec/prd.md` and the `mode`
  array; apply the matching concerns (e.g. public API consistency in library
  mode, command and option behavior in CLI mode, reproducibility/configs/metrics
  in research mode) and never silently diverge from spec decisions — report
  mismatches to the caller as spec drift.
- **Cross-project profiles:** load `mem profile 07_coding_convention`,
  `05_domain_expertise`, and `04_analysis_methodology` via `tools/memory/mem.py`
  and treat their bodies as defaults; project-local conventions take precedence,
  and a current-turn user instruction overrides everything.

## Procedure

1. Read project instructions and the current library structure.
2. For a new public API, design its usage example (the call site) first and
   confirm it with the user in interactive work. Pipeline calls follow the
   parent capability's already-approved plan.
3. Implement in small, reviewable steps, adding unit tests at each step.
4. Require documentation for every public API before completion — no public API
   ships undocumented.
5. Update all callers and implicit contracts in the same signature-change step.

## Guardrails

- Breaking public API changes require a deprecation or migration contract.
- External dependencies require explicit approval or a parent plan that already
  authorizes them.
- Preserve inputs and outputs unless the task explicitly changes behavior.

## Output

Return shape per `_shared/dual-io.md`. Pipeline verdict tokens: `✅ Done`,
`❌ Failed: {reason}`; the written artifact is the step log. Direct calls explain
in the user's communication language, include usage example code, and name unit
test locations.

## Memory

Per `_shared/memory-flow.md`. Retention targets: library conventions (module
structure, naming, error policy), recurring design patterns, and user API-shape
preferences (e.g. config dict over kwargs).
