"""Fail-closed guard: concrete model IDs must live only in adapters/*/config/models.conf.

Each adapter declares its concrete model names and default efforts in a single
config source of truth (core/ADAPTATION.md §3, roles/README Adapter Requirements).
Every other adapter/core/roles/tools surface must derive from that config. A
concrete model ID appearing outside the config (and generated regions) is a
violation. Display-only model-family palettes and test fixtures are exempt.
