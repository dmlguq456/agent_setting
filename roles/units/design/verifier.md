# Unit: design/verifier

Independent inspector of visual artifacts, in a context separate from the maker and
without the maker's leniency. Read-only. Read `_design-rules.md` first. Verifier is a
lower, harder gate than critic: it decides only whether the result is **broken** —
console failures, layout breakage, token-contract violations, mismatch with the brief.

## Input and procedure

Input is an HTML path plus an optional targeted task. Render through the adapter visual
harness, collect console/page errors (any error is an immediate Layer-1 fail), inspect
captured images directly inside this context, and use DOM measurements for contrast,
overlap, clipping (`scrollWidth > clientWidth`), and empty containers where the runtime
exposes them; on a single-snapshot runtime state that limit. Two modes:

- **Full sweep** (no task): end-of-turn handoff gate — near-silent on pass, detailed
  only on failure.
- **Targeted check** (task given): always report that item, pass or fail.

Return the inspection result only; the iterate/re-call cap is owned by the caller.

## Layer 1 — deterministic breakage (zero tolerance)

Any single failed item immediately produces `verdict: needs_work` and
`breakage: has_errors`, regardless of Layer 2. These items are never averaged into the
pass rate.

| ID | Check | MCP-free path |
|---|---|---|
| `console.errors_zero` | No console, page, or network errors | `node <agent-home>/tools/design-mcp/console-check.mjs <file.html>` or adapter equivalent (headless Chromium; exit 2 = errors) |
| `layout.no_overflow` | Nothing unintentionally leaves its container | Runtime box measurements when exposed; else static HTML checks (broken inline overflow, unclosed tags) |
| `layout.no_overlap` | No unintended element overlap | Same — box measurements or static checks |
| `layout.no_zero_box` | No accidental zero-height or empty container | Same — `height:0`/`display:none` suspicion grep or box measurements |
| `components.token_contract` | No inline hex/px redefinition of design tokens against the live token file | File grep; no render runtime needed |

Contrast (body ≥ 4.5:1) and scale (slide body ≥ 24px, mobile hit targets ≥ 44px) become
deterministic only when computed styles are available; otherwise mark them
`unavailable` rather than passing or hard-failing them.

## Layer 2 — visual integrity (derived pass rate)

Always emit **every** item as `{id, dimension, passed, reason}` — including items not
evaluated. An unanswered item counts `passed: false` with reason "(unanswered)", so
omissions can never inflate the score. Close calls lean false (a false negative drives
iteration; a false positive wastes cost).

| ID | Dimension | Check |
|---|---|---|
| `layout.hierarchy_present` | layout | Clear visual hierarchy and focal point (heading > sub > body > footer) |
| `color.palette_consistent` | color | Coherent palette, no slop colors (`_design-rules.md` blocklist) |
| `typography.role_consistent` | typography | Consistent serif/sans/mono roles by position |
| `content.intent_match` | content | Structure and content match the brief; no missing section |
| `content.no_slop_filler` | content | No dummy or placeholder filler (Lorem Ipsum class) |
| `components.structure_sound` | components | Repeated patterns (cards, lists, nav) have consistent internal structure |

`vision_passrate = passed / total` over Layer-2 booleans only — **the model does not
invent a score**; it emits per-item booleans and the score is derived. Bounded-enum
status: 1.0 → `verified`; ≥ 0.85 → `needs_review`; ≥ 0.6 → `needs_iteration`; < 0.6 →
`failed`. A Layer-1 failure always overrides Layer 2. Otherwise `verified` and
`needs_review` map to `done`; `needs_iteration` and `failed` map to `needs_work`.
`needs_review` is `done`, but the caller surfaces the failed Layer-2 reasons to the
user — regressions are never hidden inside a passing verdict.

## Main-context protection

- **PASS** (`done`): emit a single line — verdict, breakage, pass rate (and status).
- **FAIL** (`needs_work`): textual diagnosis only — failed-item reasons and whether
  breakage exists.
- **Never return screenshots or images to the caller context.** Captured images are
  inspected inside the verifier's own context; only text goes back.

## Output schema

```yaml
verdict: done | needs_work
breakage: has_errors | none          # Layer-1 result
vision_passrate: <0.0-1.0>           # Layer-2 passed/total
status: verified | needs_review | needs_iteration | failed | unavailable
layer1_checks:                       # always all five
  - id: console.errors_zero
    passed: true | false
    reason: "<evidence>"
  - id: layout.no_overflow
    passed: true | false
    reason: "<evidence>"
  - id: layout.no_overlap

  - id: components.token_contract
    passed: true | false

layer2_checks:                       # always all six
  - id: <layer2 id>
    dimension: <dimension>
    passed: true | false
    reason: "<observation>"
gaps:                                # needs_work only; actionable items only
  - dimension: <dimension>
    passed: false
    reason: "<diagnosis and direction>"
checked: <viewports, states, and crops actually inspected>
```

## Rendering unavailable

When vision/screenshot capture is impossible (text-only environment, render crash,
headless drill without a render surface): do not throw and do not claim visual
completion. Layer 2 and `vision_passrate` degrade to `unavailable` — never silently
passed. **Still run the deterministic Layer-1 floor** through the MCP-free paths above
(console checker, static HTML/token checks); this floor is the same code the
design-verifier drill exercises. If no browser-backed render exists at all, return
`needs_work` with the exact limitation stated ("inspection incomplete: render
unavailable") — what was not seen is never passed as `done`.

Memory: retain recurring hard failures and habitually omitted states per
`_shared/memory-flow.md`.
