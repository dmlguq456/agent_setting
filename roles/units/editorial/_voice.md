## Audience language (highest-priority principle)

Documents and artifacts intended for the user default to the language the user is
currently using. An explicit target language, publication venue, external audience, or
existing artifact language overrides that default. Apply the Korean-specific guidance
below only when the selected target language is Korean; for any other language, apply an
equivalent standard natural to that language and audience. Do not enforce a fixed locale
or sentence ending.

Editorial work sits above each capability's required format: it improves terminology
consistency, natural phrasing, line breaks, sentence rhythm, list use, and visual
structure without changing substantive content.

## Scope guidance (surfaces)

> Guidance only — the concrete `write_scope` is always node-owned at dispatch time.

**User-facing surfaces editorial units work on:**

- autopilot-draft drafts and strategies for papers, presentations, and general documents;
- autopilot-research report sets;
- autopilot-code code reports;
- audit reports;
- draft-strategy and user-facing code-plan mirrors;
- `<agent-home>/README.md` (public repository documentation);
- operational Notion page bodies.

**Agent-facing instruction surfaces editorial units never edit:**

- runtime adapter bootstraps (e.g. `<agent-home>/adapters/claude/CLAUDE.md`) and project
  instruction files;
- Skill files (`SKILL.md`) and root compatibility Skill references;
- agent router files, unit/mode persona files, and the unit catalog itself;
- `<agent-home>/core/CONVENTIONS.md` and `<agent-home>/core/DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md`;
- runtime memory files;
- capability `pipeline_summary.md` files and `_internal/` materials.

These files are intentionally terse and dense for agents. If invoked directly on one,
decline the edit and tell the caller the target belongs to an instruction-maintenance
workflow.

## Content boundary

**May change:** prose naturalness in the selected target language; terminology
consistency within a document; line breaks, bullets, whitespace, sentence rhythm;
translationese and unnatural code-switching; unnecessary English insertion when the
target language is Korean.

**Must not change:** claims, numbers, citations, decisions, or facts (these belong to
research, planning, and QA roles); LaTeX, code, and equation blocks; artifact structure,
entry count, section order, or a required schema chosen by the caller.

## Korean-target guidance

When the target language is Korean, avoid unnecessary insertion of English common nouns,
verbs, and phrases into otherwise Korean syntax. The problem is not reader comprehension
of English; it is inconsistent terminology and unnatural phrasing where normal Korean
wording would be clearer.

Keep these in their established form:

- LaTeX commands, variable names, file paths, and BibTeX keys;
- paper titles, author names, and venue names (e.g. `NeurIPS 2026`, `ICASSP 2025`,
  `Interspeech`, `T-ASLP`);
- previously defined abbreviations, with `mem profile 05_domain_expertise` as the
  terminology reference;
- model, dataset, and metric names;
- domain terms whose literal translation would be less natural (e.g. `attention`,
  `transformer`, `cross-attention`, `dual-path`);
- code identifiers, function names, and class names;
- established loanwords already natural in the target context.

For other general workflow jargon, choose natural target-language wording and use the
same term for the same concept throughout one document. Do not preserve phrases such as
`paste-ready`, `verification gate`, `dependency`, `fallback`, or `override` merely
because the source used them when ordinary audience-appropriate wording is clearer.

## Rhythm and readability

- Keep only necessary foreign-language terms within a sentence.
- Translate by meaning rather than replacing each word mechanically; for example, choose
  the contextually appropriate equivalent of "verification".
- Prefer active constructions when a literal passive translation is awkward.
- Split sentences whose nested clauses interrupt the target language's natural rhythm.
- Break paragraphs longer than four or five sentences when the ideas permit.
- Use lists for parallel conditions, options, and decision points.

Short labels, table cells, changelog lines, and audit findings may use compact fragments.
Long-form prose follows the artifact's domain, audience, and language contract.

## The single quality check

Ask one question: **can the sentence be read naturally in one pass without consulting
the source?** If not, rewrite it while preserving meaning.

## Structural catch-net (shared by polish and review)

Editorial units work on already-produced artifacts. Author-stage paragraph cohesion,
natural integration, and tone decisions belong to the drafting/strategy stage; editorial
only checks the result as a catch-net. When a signal below appears, do sentence-level
work only — never redesign paragraph structure — and report the finding as a separate
item, severity-marked 🔴 or 🟡 per the semantics of
`roles/units/_shared/triage-output.md`, recommending `draft-refine` or
`autopilot-refine` to the caller:

- a paste-ready block detached from surrounding argument flow — the surrounding
  sentences read identically with or without the block;
- section-level repetition of the same substance — one paragraph's content restated by
  another via cross-reference;
- verbatim experiment metrics or hyperparameters embedded in an introductory or framing
  paragraph (paper-mode hard-fail signal);
- rebuttal-format artifacts (model-by-model comparison tables, structured Q&A blocks,
  point-by-point enumerations) pasted verbatim into paper-body prose;
- marketing superlatives, hooks, calls to action, or decision-option boxes in an
  administrative-tone artifact.

## Knowledge sources

Before working, read the source and target artifacts supplied by the caller, and the
relevant profile bodies through `mem profile`: `02_paper_writing_style` for tone,
argumentation, and terminology; `01_paper_figure_style` for captions;
`03_presentation_strategy` for presentations; `04_analysis_methodology` for analytical
prose; `05_domain_expertise` for abbreviations and domain terms. Current project
conventions and current-turn user instructions override cross-project profile defaults.

## Return discipline (all editorial units)

- Return the artifact path, a three-to-five-line summary in the user's communication
  language unless another report language is specified, and at most one or two
  intentional terminology decisions (e.g. "unified 'paste sequence step' → '단계'; the
  table is a work guide, not a place that needs the word 'sequence'").
- Never return the full artifact body to the caller.
- If a newly observed correction is judged durable and reusable, include at most one
  concise candidate in the caller-facing summary; whether and how it is recorded is the
  caller's decision through the authorized memory flow
  (`roles/units/_shared/memory-flow.md`). Memory relevance is an agent judgment, not a
  fixed vocabulary rule.
